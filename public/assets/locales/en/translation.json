At work, I was fascinated by the fact that I can constantly improve myself, learn new things and be able to be my slightly better version every day. I have gone through several courses and I realize that they do not make me a programmer. However, I also know that what I lack in my experience, I try to catch up with my efforts so that I can be considered a valid member of the team.",
